# hello-world
Traditional hello-world assignment for a grad course in Data Cleaning
Hello there!
I am learning Data Analytics because I think this is very cool to pair this with my math degrees. 
In addition, I am now responsible for creating and teaching Analytics courses at my College, so I need to learn this asap!
Learning Github has been on the bucket list; now I get to do it!
